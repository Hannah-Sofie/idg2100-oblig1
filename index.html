      <h1>the SUPER Assessor - Idea generator</h1>
      <p>
        SUPER Assessor, a game designed for educators, is the result of a
        research project undertaken by the Department of Design in Trondheim.
        Its primary objective is to aid educators in the development of unique
        assessment methods. These methods are intended to create innovative ways
        to evaluate and grade students.
